## hw1
(modified from codes provided in the class)

This homework is aimed for simulating busses arrival to the maintenance facility including one inspection station and two repair stations.
### Requirements:
* A repaired bus needs to be re-inspected with probability p (according to the last digit of your student ID, divided by 10, plus 0.1 .i.e. If the last digit of your student ID is 8, then probability p is 0.8+0.1 = 0.9.)
* The probability of passing the inspection for any bus is 0.7
* Obtain the utilization of the Inspection station and each Repair Shop via simulation for different bus arrival rates (such as lambda =0.2, 0.4, 0.6...3.0/hr) for 160 hours.
* inspection times: uniform 0.25 hr to 1.05 hr
* repair times: uniform 2.1 hr to 4.5 hr

## hw3_4
For truncated normal distribution simulation.

## Final project
Try to simulate the result of a conference paper
This final project is mainly based on the paper from 2019 Globecom: A SDN-Assisted Energy Saving Scheme for Cooperative Edge Computing Networks. This paper proposed an SDN-assisted cooperative edge computing scheme including
* sleeping mechanism
* load balancing scheme
